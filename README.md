# Interview questions

## Interstellar

The folder `interstellar` contains a .js file containing a small coding excercise.
Please complete the task described, and make sure it passes the tests. Feel free to add
any new test cases you may think of - we will have some new test cases to apply once you have
provided your solution.

The goal of this test is to show that you can interpret an informal specification and
implement a solution which meets acceptance criteria.

## Angular

Please implement an Angular.js widget to render a profile widget as shown in the `target.png`
file.

The example data is provided in a skeleton controller implementation.

The goal of this test is to assess your experience with Angular.js, HTML and CSS. If you are
not comfortable writing an Angular widget, you may also simply implement the HTML and CSS
without the data binding to the example data (just hard code the data).

## Questions

Please send any questions or issues with the problems to <mike@stashmetrics.com> - I'm sure there's
something I've missed or not clearly explained, so please do ask rather than feel I've set a
trick question.

## Submission

Please re-zip your solution and send it to <mike@stashmetrics.com> when you are done.

Good luck!

Mike Houston
CTO, Stashmetrics.
